Steps to run the script:

### Team
- Aina Llaneras
- Maria Angelica Jaimes
- Xavier Querol 
- Bernat Comas


### Running script for the first time

Execute main.py by running:
```bash
 python3 main.py
 ```

Then a menu will be displayed with the instructions to execute any combination of hyperparameters. Follow the instructions
- If you put in a wrong parameter the app will make you input it again.
- You can put both the number in the left side of the parameter and the name of the parameter itself as shown in the options.

If you want to run all the KNN options you can choose to do it one by one through the main menu or by executing the function runAllKNN present in the file main.py. We recommend the first option because running everything is a very long process.
